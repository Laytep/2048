## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy the game on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Game State Tracking**: Automatically detects win or loss conditions.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your highest score across sessions.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply visit [https://laytep.github.io/2048/](https://laytep.github.io/2048/). Use the arrow keys (on desktop) or swipe (on mobile devices) to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their values added up. The goal is to create a tile with a value of 2048.
